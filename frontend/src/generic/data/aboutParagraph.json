        "During university, I have taken on my projects. The largest one would be an open world voxel game called Blockzone that I made from scratch. I was curious how rendering engines worked and how a graphics card drew objects on a screen and decided to make this game from scratch. What I enjoyed most about this project was learning about the underlying technology and the process of discovery where I'd find notice a problem and then dig into solving it, learning a lot in the process.",
